## Build order

```
Epic 1 (Service foundation)
  └─▶ Epic 2 (Auth and access control)
        └─▶ Epic 3 (Multi-bucket S3 orchestration)
              └─▶ Epic 4 (Storage API surface)
                    └─▶ Epic 5 (Daily cost notifier (Discord))
                          └─▶ Epic 6 (Hardening, observability, and deploy)
```

## Watch out for

- **2.1** JWT audience and issuer mismatch is the most common source of false 401 responses in service-to-service auth.
- **3.2** STS role trust policy and external ID drift can silently block bucket access in production.
- **5.3** Cost Explorer data freshness can lag; daily Discord summaries are near-daily visibility, not real-time accounting.
- **5.5** Cron overlap can duplicate daily Discord sends; enforce single-instance lock and dedupe key.
- **6.5** Cron overlap can send duplicate notices; add lock files or systemd single-instance protections.

## Secure baseline profile (recommended for your two-user app)

Use private S3 buckets with backend-authorized access only. This keeps the model simple, secure, and easy to extend later.

### Required security controls

- Bucket controls:
      - Block all public access at bucket and account level.
      - Do not create bucket policies that allow anonymous `s3:GetObject`.
      - Enforce server-side encryption (SSE-S3 at minimum, SSE-KMS if needed later).
- Backend controls:
      - Require authenticated sessions/tokens for every image route.
      - Resolve caller app identity (`app_id`) from token and enforce app policy before S3 calls.
      - Authorize object access by owner/project fields before reading from S3.
      - Use IAM role or scoped access keys only on the backend (never in frontend).
- Database controls:
      - Store object keys and metadata only; never store AWS credentials.
      - Include ownership fields (`owner_user_id`, `project_id`, `visibility`) for future multi-user growth.
- Observability:
      - Enable CloudWatch request/error metrics for S3.
      - Add low-cost AWS budget alarms to catch accidental usage spikes.

### Endpoint changes for Option 1 (backend streams images)

For your use case, prefer backend streaming and avoid exposing direct S3 download links.

- Keep / add:
      - `POST /v1/objects/upload` (authenticated upload via backend)
      - `GET /v1/images/:id` (authenticated image stream from backend)
      - `GET /v1/images` (authenticated list with metadata)
      - `DELETE /v1/images/:id` (authenticated delete with ownership check)
- Change:
      - Make `POST /v1/objects/presign-download` optional or admin-only. Default should be disabled.
      - If download links are needed for sharing later, issue very short-lived links and log all issuance.
- Do not add:
      - Public image endpoints (for example: `GET /public/images/:id`).

### API response shape for image URLs

To support frontend `<img>` tags while staying private, return your backend URL (not a raw S3 URL).

- Example `GET /v1/images` item:

```json
{
      "id": "img_123",
      "owner_user_id": "user_1",
      "mime_type": "image/jpeg",
      "size_bytes": 183442,
      "created_at": "2026-03-22T19:20:00Z",
      "url": "/v1/images/img_123"
}
```

This gives the frontend a stable URL while the backend still performs auth + S3 retrieval.

### Mapping to current tasks

- Add a task in Epic 4 for `GET /v1/images/:id` streaming endpoint.
- Re-scope **4.5** (`presign-download`) to optional/non-default mode.
- Add ownership checks to read/delete handlers so auth rules are enforced consistently.
